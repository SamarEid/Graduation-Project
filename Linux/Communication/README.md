A high-performance bridge between STM32 (via SPI) and Raspberry Pi (via MQTT) for real-time sensor data and actuator control in ADAS/IoT systems.

This application facilitates bidirectional seamless communication between an STM32 microcontroller and a Raspberry Pi 4. It:

- Reads sensor data (ultrasonic distances) from the STM32 and publishes them to an MQTT broker.
- Subscribes to actuator commands (e.g., brake) and forwards them to the STM32.
- Designed for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) or IoT edge computing.

## <a id="features"></a>‚ú® Key Features

| Feature                         | Description                                                                     |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bidirectional Communication** | SPI-to-MQTT for sensors, MQTT-to-SPI for actuators                              |
| **Thread-Safe**                 | Lock-protected SPI operations & queue-based command processing                  |
| **Self-Healing**                | Auto-reconnects to MQTT broker on failure                                       | 
| **Modular Design**              | JSON-configurable topics and parameters                                         |
| **Error Handling**              | Logs SPI/MQTT errors and falls back to defaults if config.json is missing.      |
| **Diagnostics**                 | Heartbeat monitoring + detailed logging for tracking info, warnnings or errors. |
| **Clean Shutdown**	            | Gracefully closes SPI/MQTT connections on exit or failure.                      |

## <a id="implementation"></a>üõ† Technical Implementation

### 1. SPI Communication
- Protocol: Uses spidev to read sensor data in the format [0xA0, front, left, right, 0xB0].

- Thread Safety: SPI operations are protected by threading.Lock() to prevent race conditions.

### 2. MQTT Integration
- Broker: Connects to Mosquitto (default: localhost:1883).

- Topics:

    Publishes: `sensors/front`, `sensors/left`, `sensors/right`, `sensors/heartbeat`.

    Subscribes: `actuators/break` (for brake commands).

- Last Will Testament (LWT): Notifies if the Pi disconnects unexpectedly.

### 3. Logging
- Logs critical events (e.g., SPI failures, MQTT disconnections, Sensor Readings) via Python‚Äôs logging module.
